# Projet GameOn

In the framework of the formation of design and development front-end of app in React and Js I had to forked this project and complete the functions in order to validate a suscribe form. 

Also the css responsive had to be modified to respond to the technical sheets and the mockup receieved for this project.

In this project I started to understand the use and the logic of the functions, the access to the DOM and the conditional structurres.

Each cell of the subscribe form has been checked wiht a function. Creating a modular program where each function can be customized upon user needs.

### Technolgoies
-   HMTL
-   CSS
-   Javascript
-   ChatGPT (To check errors in the functions)
